        Are we gonna make it?<br>
        Is this gonna hurt?<br>
        Oh, we can try to sedate it, but that never works<br>
        Yeah
    </p>
    <p>
        I start to imagine a world where we don't collide<br>
        It's making me sick, but we'll heal and the Sun will rise
    </p>
    <p>
        If you tell me you're leaving<br>
        I'll make it easy, it'll be okay<br>
        If we can't stop the bleeding<br>
        We don't have to fix it, we don't have to stay
    </p>
    <p>
        I will love you either way<br>
        Ooh, it'll be, oh, be okay<br>
        Ooh
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh, the future we dreamed of is fading to black<br>
        Oh, oh<br>
        Oh, thеre's nothing more painful<br>
        Nothing more painful (ooh)
    </p>
    <p>
        I start to imaginе a world where we don't collide<br>
        And it's making me sick, but we'll heal and the Sun will rise
    </p>
    <p>
        If you tell me you're leaving<br>
        I'll make it easy, it'll be okay (it'll be okay)<br>
        And if we can't stop the bleeding<br>
        We don't have to fix it, we don't have to stay (don't have to stay)
    </p>
    <p>
        I will love you either way<br>
        Ooh, it'll be, oh, be okay<br>
        Ooh
    </p>
    <p>
        I will love you either way<br>
        Might be so sweet<br>
        Might be so bitter
    </p>
    <p>
        I will love you either way<br>
        Might be so sweet<br>
        Might be so bitter (ooh)
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh<br>
        If the future we've dreamed of is fading to black<br>
        I will love you either way
